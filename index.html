	<h1>Rebecca and Sam's Wedding</h1>
	<p>Welcome to our wedding website, here you'll find all the information for our big day!</p>
	<p>We have decided to have a <a href="./ceremony.html" target="_top">Quaker wedding</a>, which will be new and perhaps unusual for most of you. We want you to all feel as comfortable as possible on the day, and so you can find a section of the website dedicated to what a Quaker ceremony will be like. We are both more than happy to chat further about this, or answer any other questions you might have - please donâ€™t be too shy to ask!</p>
	<p>We ask that each invited person fills out the <a href="./rsvp.html" target="_top">RSVP</a> form by the 1<sup>st</sup> June. We're excited to share a feast in celebration of our marriage, so this will help us capture final numbers and dietary requirements. </p>
	<p>You'll also find a page about timings of the <a href="./theday.html" target="_top">day</a>, <a href="./hotels.html" target="_top">hotels and transport</a>, but please do reach out to us if you need any more information.</p>
	<p>We can't wait to celebrate with you all!</p>
