	<h1>💑 The Day</h1>
	
	<p>The wedding will be at:</p>
	
	<h2>The Mount Without, Upper Church Ln, Bristol BS2 8FN</h2>
	
	<p>The ceremony will commence at 12:00 and we will be welcoming guests from 11:30 at the entrance to the Mount Without.</p>
	<p>After the ceremony, which should conclude at approximately 13:00, we will move to the garden and crypt for drinks whilst the hall is reconfigured for food.</p>
	<p>Day guests are invited at approximately 14:00 to join us for a feast to celebrate our wedding.</p>
	<p>After the feast, there will be speeches, readings, and maybe even a song or two!</p>
	<p>At 19:00 we invite all of our guests to join us downstairs in the crypt for dancing and drinks!</p>
	<p>Pizza will be served from 19:30 for two hours, grab a slice or two at your leisure.</p>
	<p>We hope to wind down and retreat to our hotel at midnight and we will say goodbye then!</p>
